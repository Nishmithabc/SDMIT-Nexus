Make sure you add your *gmail account name* and your *app password* within that double quotation which is in utils/otp_utils and utils/send_password.
Also remember to add the *secret key* in utils/auth_utils
one more thing you need to do is create a private and public key and then store it in backend with .pem extension
how to run the backend?
use this command :  uvicorn main:app --reload
